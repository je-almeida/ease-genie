# Ease Genie

This project is Edge ready (Vercel Edge runtime)

This is a starter project/boilerplate to start out with:

- TRPC
- App directory/router
- Prisma
- Supabase (Auth, Storage, Serverless Queries)
- Tailwind
- Edge Ready
- Umami analytics

It allows us to call database in server components through supabase-js, for client component we are using trpc+prisma due to the superior DX
